    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layered sheets of wide flat pasta, typically layered with ingredients such as ricotta cheese, ground meat (usually beef or pork), tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese. The pasta sheets are often pre-cooked before layering to ensure they are tender when the dish is baked. The layers are then baked in an oven until the pasta is cooked through and the top is golden and bubbly.</p>
